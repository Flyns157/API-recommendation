"""
This module defines the structure and implementation of a recommendation engine for social networks,
focused on suggesting users, posts, and threads based on shared connections and interests. It
provides an abstract base class `recommender_engine` with unimplemented recommendation methods,
and two concrete classes, `MC_engine` and `JA_engine`, each with distinct recommendation strategies.

Classes:
    recommender_engine: Abstract base class for building a recommendation engine. Provides method
        templates for recommending users, posts, and threads.
    MC_engine: Monte Carlo-based implementation of `recommender_engine`. Suggests users, posts, and
        threads based on mutual connections and engagement patterns.
    JA_engine: A recommendation engine implementation that uses a combination of mutual follows and
        interest-based scores. Provides additional methods for fetching user hashtags and calculating
        recommendation scores.

Usage:
    Create an instance of `Database`, pass it to an `MC_engine` or `JA_engine` instance, and call the
    relevant recommendation methods. For example, `recommend_users(user_id)`, `recommend_posts(user_id)`,
    or `recommend_threads(user_id)`.
